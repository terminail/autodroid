I'll split the translated document into several logical standalone files based on content categories:

1. **README.md** - Main project documentation
   - Project Overview (1.1-1.3)
   - Key features and value proposition
   - Quick start links

2. **requirements.md** - Complete requirements specification
   - Functional Requirements (F001-F006)
   - Non-functional Requirements (Performance, Reliability, Compatibility)

3. **architecture.md** - System design documentation
   - Overall Architecture diagram and description
   - Container Service Architecture

4. **technical-solution.md** - Technical implementation details
   - Technology Stack Selection
   - Core Module Design (Device Connection Pool, Intelligent Scheduler, Event-Driven Execution)
   - Workflow Definition Specification

5. **installation-guide.md** - Setup and deployment instructions
   - Environment Preparation (Java SDK, Android SDK, Appium)
   - Device Configuration
   - Containerized Deployment (Docker/Podman setup)
   - Multi-Platform Deployment Configuration

6. **usage-guide.md** - User instructions
   - Quick Start
   - Container Deployment
   - Creating Test Plans
   - Daily Operations (Monitoring, Managing Test Plans)

7. **appendix.md** - Additional reference materials
   - Troubleshooting
   - Performance Optimization Suggestions
   - Extension Development Guide

8. **implementation-plan.md** - Development roadmap
   - Phased implementation plan with deliverables

This structure will make the documentation more organized and easier to navigate, allowing users to access specific information without reading through the entire document.
